If you look in [this lab's repository](https://github.com/lcthomas/engl6701s24-lab4) (and/or to the left of this notebook in the JupyterLab file interface), you will find a file there named `example_file.txt`.

This tells our code where to look for the file we want to open.\n",

    "    - The syntax `with open()` is a short-hand way to open the file and then automatically close it once Python has read its contents. In older versions of Python, you had to make sure to both open files and then close them when you were done with them, but this syntax automatically closes files.\n",
    "    - We can see that the thing being opened is assigned to the `example_file` variable.\n",
    "    - The `r` after the variable name tells Python to \"read\" the contents of the file. There are various options you can use here; to explore others, Google someting like \"Python file open options.\" In fact, we don't need to explicitly include the `r` here, as it's the default option with the `open()` function.\n",
    "    - The `as fin` portion of the code is assigning the data contained within \"example_file.txt\" to the variable `fin` (this variable is often used by people writing Python to mean \"file-input\").\n",
    "3. Line 4, which must be indented, tells the code to read the input file line by line. As you can see if you take a look at \"example_file.txt\" in this lab's GitHub repo, there is only one line in this file. Note: we could have used anything for the `line` variable here; the code would work just as well if it read `for x in fin:`. But I've used the variable `line` to remind myself that what I am doing here is reading the file line by line.\n",

I wrote it only about six months after learning Python. Looking back at it now, I can identify places in the code where I could be less verbose and more efficient, or where I could structure the steps differently in order to speed up processing.
